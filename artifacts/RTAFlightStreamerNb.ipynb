Every line of the CSV (1260 rows) represents a plane sighting. i.e. the aircraft transponder signal was detected by an open-source plan tracker and they recorded important data about the aircraft such as heading, velocity, longitude and latitude. The granularity of the data is one reading every 10 seconds.\n","\n","The notebook will stream one row at at time (roughly 1 row/sec) into the custom app endpoint of the Event Stream. This will then be sent to the KQL database. The cell Marked \"0\" is where you set your parameters.
